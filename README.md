# grid-of-life

This is a small project that is great for teaching others how to program. It's not too difficult, 
but it requires more thought than most simple projects and the result is fun to play with and look 
at. It simulates bacteria using rules from
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules).
